    <b>Early developments</b>
    Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry
    or setting banks of physical controls.

Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes
each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly.
For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation
and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper
tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages were later termed 
The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or assembly languages, 
which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program
much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.
The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), 
were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. 
However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.
Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. 
It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper
found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, 
she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and
implemented a prototype.[33] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.
FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.
