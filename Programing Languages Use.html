            Thousands of different <b> programming languages </b> have been created, mainly in the computing field
            Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.
            Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require 
            a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate
            with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors,
            and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly
            what they are told to do",and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write.
            The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify
            the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program.
            On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution
            by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.
            A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data,
            and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. 
            <b>A programmer</b> uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation.
            Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type
            commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the "commands" are simply programs,
            whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter
